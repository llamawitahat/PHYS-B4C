* Problem 1
+ Two slits are separated by 0.370 mm. A beam of 510-nm light strikes the slits, producing an interference pattern. Determine the number of maxima observed in the angular range -31.0º ≤ $\theta$ ≤ 31.0º.

** Important values
+ $d = 0.370 mm$
+ $\lambda = 510nm$

** Equation
+ $d\sin{\theta} = m\lambda$

** Solving the thing
+ Need $m$

  \[m = \frac{d\sin{\theta}}{\lambda}\]

+ Pretty easy to just plug in the values here

  \[m = \frac{(0.370\times 10^{-3}m)(\sin{\text{31\textdegree}})}{510\times 10^{-9}m\]

  \[m = 373.7\]

  For -31.0º:

  \[m = -373.7\]

  \[\Delta m \approx 747\]


* Problem 2
+ A laser beam is incident on two slits with a incident on two slits with a separation of 0.215 mm, and a screen is placed 4.50 m from the slits. An interference pattern appears on the screen. If the angle from the center fringe to the first brigt fringe to the side is 0.178º, what is the wavelength of the laser light?

** Important values
 - \(d = 0.215mm\)
 - \(L = 4.50m\)
 - \(\theta = \text{0.178\textdegree} \)
 - \(m=1\)

** Equations

\[d\sin{\theta_{bright}} = m \lambda\]

\[y_{bright} = L\frac{m\lambda}{d}\]

\[\tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{L} \implies y = L\tan{\theta} \implies y = (4.50m)(\tan{\text{0.178\textdegree})} = 0.014m\]

\[\lambda = \frac{y_{bright}d}{Lm} \]

\[\lambda = \frac{(0.014m)(0.215\times 10^{-3})}{4.50m} \]

\[\lambda = 6.69\times 10^{-7} = 669nm\]


* Problem 3
+ Light of wavelength 741 nm falls on a double slit, and the first bright fringe of the interference pattern is seen at an angle of 17.0º with the horizontal. Find the separation between the slits.

** Important values
- \(m = 1\)
- \(\theta = \text{178\textdegree}\)
- \(\lambda = 741nm\)

** Equations

\[d\sin{\theta} = m\lambda\]

\[d = \frac{m\lambda}{\sin{\theta}} \]

\[d = \frac{(1)(741\times 10^{-9})}{\sin{17.0}}\]

\[d = 2.53\mu m\]


* Problem 4

** Part A
+ An air wedge is formed between two glass plates separated at one edge by a very fine wire of circular cross section as shown in the figure below.

  [[../Chapter 36/37-p-035.gif]]

  When the wedge is illuminated ffrom above by 600 nm light and viewed from above, 30 dark fringes are observed. Calculate the diameter /d/ of the wire (in µm).

*** Values
+ \(\lambda = 600nm\)
+ \(m = 30\)
+ \(n=1.52\)

*** Solution

\[2t = m\lambda \]

\[ t = \frac{m\lambda}{2} \]

\[t = \frac{(29)(600\times 10^{-9})}{2} = 8.7\mu m \]

** Part B
+ What If? How many dark fringes will be observed if the gap between the glass plates is filled with water?

*** One important value to add
+ \[n = 1.33\] (index of refraction for water)

*** Solution

\[2nt = m\lambda \]

\[ m = \frac{2nt}{\lambda} \]

\[m = \frac{2(1.33)(8.7\times 10^{-6})}{600 \times 10^{-9}} \]

\[ m = 39 \]


* Problem 5
+ A film of \(MgF_2\) (n = 1.38) having thickness \(1.54\times 10^{-5}cm\) is used to coat a camera lens

** Part A
What are the three longest wavelengths that are intesified in the reflected light? (Enter answers from smallest to largest)

*** Values
+ \(n = 1.38\)
+ \(t = 1.54\times 10^{-5}\)
+ \(m = 0,1,2\)

*** Solution

\[ 2nt = (m+\frac{1}{2})\lambda \]

\[ \implies \lambda = \frac{2nt}{m} \]

\[\lambda_1 = 144nm \]
\[\lambda_2 = 216nm\]
\[\lambda_3 = 433nm\]
