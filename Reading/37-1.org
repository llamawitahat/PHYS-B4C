#+title: 37.1 Introduction to Diffraction Patterns

In [[~/Documents/PHYS-B4C/Chapter 36/Reading/36-1.org][Chapter 36.1]], we learned that light of wavelength larger than a slit spreads out in all directions. This phenomenon is called /diffraction/.

* What are diffraction patterns?
+ A *diffaction pattern* consisting of light and dark areas is observed as the result of a light wave passing through the slit and spreading out in all directions.
+ The pattern consists of a broad, intense central band called the *central maximum* flanked by a series of narrower, less intense additional bands called
  + *side maxima*
  + *secondary maxima*

  + This is what a diffraction pattern looks like
