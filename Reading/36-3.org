#+title: 36.3 Intensity Distribution of the Double-Slit Interference Pattern

When looking at the double-slit experiment, the change from dark to bright is not sharp. The change is gradual.

Using an analysis of the electric fields of the light from the two slits, we can show that the intensity of light on the screen is given by

\[ I = I_{max} \cos^2{\left(\frac{\pi d \sin{\theta}}{\lambda}\right) \]

Alternatively, because $\sin{\theta} \approx y/L$ for small values of $\theta$, we can write the above equation in the form

\[I = I_{max} \cos^{2}{\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda L} y \right)} \] (small angles)

Constructive interference, which produces light intensity maxima, occurs when the quantity $\pi dy / \lambda L$ is an integral multiple of $\pi$, corresponding to $y = Lm\lambda / d$, where $m$ is the order number.
