* Electromagnetic radiation using the particle model
+ The probability per unit volume of finding a photon in a given region of space at an instant of time is proportional to the number of photons per unit volume at that time:

  \[ \frac{\text{Probability}}{V} \propto \frac{N}{V} \]

+ The number of photons per unit volume is proportional to the intensity of the radiation:

  \[ \frac{N}{V} \propto I \]

** Connecting this (the particle model) to the wave model
+ Recall that the intensity of electromagnetic radiation is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude $E$ for the electromagnetic wave

  \[ I \propto E^{2} \]

+ Equating this relationship to the first one mentioned gives

  \[ \frac{\text{Probability}}{V} \propto E^{2} \]

+ Therefore, the probability per unit volume of finding a particle associated with this radiation (of the photon) is proportional to the square amplitude of its associated electromagnetic wave.

** Probability Amplitude & the Wave Function

\[ \psi(x) = Ae^{ikx} \]
