* Single-Slit

Angle depends on how close the observer is to the target


[[./imgs/37-3-angles.png]]


+ For a singular slit, the minimum angle to resolve the two images is

  \[ \sin{\theta} = \frac{\lambda}{a} \]

  where $a$ is the width of the slit.

+ Because \[ \lambda \ll a \] in most situations, $\sin{\theta}$ is small and we can use the approximation $\sin{\theta} \approx \theta$.

+ Therefore, the angle of resolution for a slit of width $a$ is

  \[\theta_{\text{min}} = \frac{\lambda}{a} \]

  where \(\theta_{\text{min}}\) is expressed in *radians* (do not forget about this on a test).

* Circular Apertures

+ Analysis shows that the minimum angle to resolve two images in a circular aperture is

  \[ \theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{D} \]

  where $D$ is the diameter of the aperture.


* Examples

** Example 37.2 Resolution of the Eye
+ Light of wavelength 500 nm, near the center of the visible spectrum, enters a human eye. Although pupil diameter varies from person to person, let's estimate a daytime diameter of 2 mm.

+ Estimate the limiting angle of resolution for this eye, assuming its resolution is limited only by diffraction.

*** Solution
+ *Conceptualize*: Identify the pupil of the eye as the aperture through which the light travels. Light passing through this small aperture causes diffraction patterns to occur on the retine
+ *Categorize*: We determine the result using equations developed in this section, so we categorize this example as a substitution problem

  \[ \theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D} = 1.22 \left(\frac{5.00\times 10^{-7} \text{ m}}{2\times 10^{-3} \text{ m}} \right) = \boxed{3\times 10^{-7}\text{ rad}} \approx \boxed{\text{1 min of arc}}  \]

  where a minute of arc is $1/60$ of a degree.


** Example 37.3 Resolution of a Telescope
+ Each of the two telescopes at the Keck Observatory on the dormant Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii has an effective diameter of $\text{10 m}$. What is its limiting angle of resolution for \(\text{600-nm}\) light?

*** Solution
+ *Conceptualize*: Identify the aperture through which the light travels as the opening of the telescope. Light passing through this aperture causes diffraction patterns to occur in the final image.
+ *Categorize*: We determine the result using equations developed in this section, se we categorize this example as a substitution problem.

  \[ \theta_{\text{min}} = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{D} = 1.22\left(\frac{6.00\times 10^{-7}\text{ m}}{10 \text{ m}} \right) = \boxed{7.3\times10^{-8}\text{ rad}} \approx \boxed{0.015\text{ s of arc}} \]

  where a second of arc is $1/60$ of a minute of arc.
