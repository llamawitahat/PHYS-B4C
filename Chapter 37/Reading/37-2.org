* Fraunhofer diffraction pattern
How do we obtain a similar pattern as the double slit diffraction pattern with just a single slit?

b) Simulation of a single-slit Fraunhofer  diffraction pattern

** Analyzing the pattern

+ Divide the slit into two halves
+ All waves are in phase as they leave the slit
+ Ray 1 travels further than ray 3 equal to the path difference multiplied by the sin of the angle
+ Same conditions for interference as in [[~/Documents/PHYS-B4C/Chapter 36/Reading/36-2.org][Section 36.2]] apply here
+ Waves from the upper half of the slit interfere with waves from the lower half when

  \[\frac{a}{2}\sin{\theta} = \frac{\lambda}{2} \]

+ For either above or below the dashed line (middle of the slit), we can generalize this as

  \[\sin{\theta} = \pm\frac{\lambda}{a} \]

+ Dividing the slit into four equal parts and using similar reasoning, we find that the viewing screen is also dark when

  \[\frac{a}{4}\sin{\theta} = \pm \frac{\lambda}{2} \implies \sin{\theta} = \pm 2 \frac{\lambda}{a} \]

+ SO, the general condition for destructive interference is

  \[\sin{\theta_{\text{dark}} = m\frac{\lambda}{a} \]        \[m = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3,...  \]


* Intensity of Single-Slit Diffraction Patterns

Analysis of the intensity variation in a diffraction pattern from a single slit of width $a$ shows that the intensity is given by

\[I = I_{\text{max}}\left[\frac{\sin{(\pi a \sin{\theta/\lambda})}}{\pi a \sin{\theta/\lambda}}\right]^2 \]

where $I_{\text{max}}$ is the intensity at $\theta = 0$ (the central maximum) and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light used to illuminate the slit
