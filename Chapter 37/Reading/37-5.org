#+title: 37.5 Diffraction of X-Rays by Crystals
#+startup: latexpreview inlineimages

* Crystals and X-Rays
+ Pretty much any electromagnetic wave can be determined if a grating of proper spacing is available
+ (1913) Max von Laue suggested that the regular array of atoms in a crystal could act as a three-dimensional diffraction grating for x-rays.
  - Subsequent experiments confirmed this prediction

** X-Ray Observations
+ Weird arrangement of dots is called a /Laue pattern/
+ You can figure out the crystalline structures this way!

*** More Laue pattern visuals
a) A Laue pattern of a single crystal of the mineral beryl
b) A Laue pattern of the enzyme Rubisco, produced with a wideband x-ray spectrum

** Bragg's law
+ Condition for constructive interference for upper and lower x-ray beams

\[ 2d \sin{\theta} = m\lambda \]        \[ m = 1,2,3,... \]
