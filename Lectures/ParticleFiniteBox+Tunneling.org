* Particle in a Box & Schrödinger Equation (quick review)

Check back [[./Schrodinger Eq.org][here]]

* Particle in a box (finite height)

\[ \frac{d^{2}\psi}{dx^{2}} = \frac{2m(U-E)}{\hbar^{2}}\psi = C^{2}\psi \]

\[ C^{2} = \frac{2m(U - E)}{\hbar^{2}} \]

[[./potentialwell.png]]

\[ \psi = Ae^{Cx}+Be^{-Cx} \] for regions I and III

\[ \psi = F\sin{kx} + G\cos{kx} \] for region II

(See OpenStax textbook for more details)

There's a chance of finding the particle outside of the box??

* Tunneling Through a Barrier

[[./potentialbarrier.png]]

+ Outside of barrier particle has a sinusoidal function
+ Decreasing exponential function inside of barrier

\[ T = e^{-2L\sqrt{\frac{2m(U-E)}{\hbar^{2}}}} \]

\[T+R=1\]

* Practice Problems
** Practice Problem 1
The Schrödinger equation for a particle trapped in a one-dimensional is given by:

\[ -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}\psi}{dx^{2}}-\left( \frac{b\hbar^{2}}{mx} \right)\psi  = E\psi \]

Assume the solution of the normalized wave function is given by:

\[ \psi(x) = Cxe^{-bx} \]

Substitute the wave function into the Schrödinger equation and find the energy $E$ of the system in terms of $\hbar$, m, and b.

*** Solution

\[ \frac{d\psi}{dx} = Ce^{-bx}-bCxe^{-bx} \]

\[ \frac{d^{2}\psi}{dx^{2}} = b^{2}Cxe^{-bx} -2bCe^{-bx} \]

Plugging into Schrödinger equation

\[ -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}(b^{2}Cxe^{-bx}-2bCe^{-bx}) - \left( \frac{b\hbar^{2}}{mx} \right)Cxe^{-bx} = ECxe^{-bx} \]

Reducing this bad boy gets us

\[ E = \boxed{-\frac{\hbar^{2}b^{2}}{2m}} \]

** Practice Problem 2
An incoming electron is incident on a rectangular potential energy barrier. The barrier's height is 2.5 eV and its width is 0.40 nm. What energy (in eV) would the electron to have if it were to have a 2.0% probability of being able to quantum mechanically tunnel through the barrier?

*** Solution

\[ T = e^{-2L\sqrt{\frac{2m(U-E)}{\hbar^{2}}}} \]

\[ \ln{T} = -2L\sqrt{\frac{2m(U-E)}{\hbar^{2}}} \]

\[ \frac{\ln{\frac{1}{T}}}{2L} = -\sqrt{\frac{2m(U-E)}{\hbar^{2}}} \]

\[ \frac{\hbar^{2}\ln^{2}{\frac{1}{T}}}{8mL^{2}} = U - E \]

\[ E = U -\frac{\hbar^{2}\ln^{2}{\frac{1}{T}}}{8mL^{2}} \]

\[\dots\]

\[ E = 2.55\times 10^{-19}\text{ J} = \boxed{1.59\text{ eV}} \]
