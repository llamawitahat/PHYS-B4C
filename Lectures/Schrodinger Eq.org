* Particle in a 1D Box

[[./ProbabilityDensity+ParticleInfiniteBox.org][Quick Review from last time]]

\[ \psi(x) = A\sin{\left( \frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} \right)} \]

\[ \psi_{n}(x) = A\sin{\left(\frac{ n\pi x}{L}\right) \]

+ Normalized:

  \[ \boxed{ \psi_{n}(x)= \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin{\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)}  } \]

  - This time, the wave function is REAL!

    * For first state, you have the best chance of your particle being in the middle
    * Not the case for \(n = 2\)
    * Is the case for \(n = 3\)
    * And so on...
+ What if $n$ were a really large number like 5000?
  - Our wave effectively appears like a straight line, so we're dealing with something macroscopic

** Momentum of the Particle in the box

\[ p_{n} = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{h}{2L/n} = \frac{nh}{2L} \]

+ Only dependent on the length of the box

\[ E_{n} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} = \frac{p_{n}^{2}}{2m} \]

\[ \boxed{E_{n} = \left( \frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}} \right)n^{2}} \]         \[ n= 1,2,3,... \]

+ You're NEVER going to get 0 energy in this case

* Schrödinger Equation

\[ -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}\psi}{dx^{2}} + U\psi = E\psi \]

+ Basically just an expression of the law of conservation of energy

** Particle in a Box - Revisited
+ No potential energy, so it boils down to

  \[ \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}\psi}{dx^{2}} = E\psi \]

  \[ \frac{d^{2}\psi}{dx^{2}} = -\frac{2mE}{\hbar^{2}}\psi = -k^{2}\psi \]

  \[ k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar} \]

  \[ \psi(x) = A\sin{kx} + B\cos{kx} \]

*** Boundary Conditions
+ Check left boundary: \(\psi(0) = 0\)

  \[ \psi(0) = 0+B = 0 \]

  \[ \therefore\psi(x) = A\sin{kx} \]

+ Check right boundary: \(\psi(L)=0 \)

  \[ \psi(L)=\frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}L=n\pi \]

  \[ \therefore kL = n\pi \]

+ Well, we're done

  \[ E_{n} = \left( \frac{h^{2}}{8mL^{2}} \right)n^{2}\text{   $\checkmark$ } \]

  \[ \psi_{n} = A\sin{\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)} \text{  } \checkmark \]

  - Only works for a particle in a 1D box

* Problems
** Practice Problem 1
*** Part A
An electron is trapped in a one-dimensional box of length 0.250 nm. Calculate its speed in the \(n = 2\) state.
**** Solution

\[ p_{n} = \frac{nh}{2L} = mv \]

\[ \implies v = \frac{nh}{2mL} = 2.91\times 10^{6}\text{ m/s} \]

*** Part B
A 145 g baseball is trapped between two rigid walls, modeled as a box of length 91.44 m, the length of a football field. Calculate the speed of the baseball in the \(n = 2\) state.
**** Solution
+ More of the same

  \[ p_{n} = \frac{nh}{2L} = mv \]

  \[ \implies v = \frac{nh}{2mL} = 5.00\times 10^{-35}\text{ m/s} \]

** Practice Problem 2
An electron is trapped in a one-dimensional box when it transitions from its \(n = 2\) state to its \(n=1\) state. After the transition, a photon with wavelength 638.2 nm is emitted. Calculate the length of the box (in nm).
*** Solution

\[ E_{\gamma} = E_{2} - E_{1} \]

\[ L = \sqrt{\frac{3h\lambda}{8mc}} \]
