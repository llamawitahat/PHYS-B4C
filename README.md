# Notes for My Physics III Course

Idk what to add here. I think it's pretty straightforward what this is. I just write my notes in LaTeX then export them to pdf. You are free to use these notes as you please, but remember that they are not a substitute for attending lecture. A lot of these notes are based on the textbook required for the course and the in-person lectures, which may differ from the ones in your own course. View these more as a supplement to your own work/notes/learning.
