\section*{Dispersion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Index of refraction considering ratios between different speeds: \[n = \frac{c}{v}\]
    \item Index of refraction considering ratio between wavelengths: \[n = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{n}}\]
    \subitem $\lambda$ = wavelength of light in a vacuum
    \subitem $\lambda_{n}$ = wavelength of light in other material
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Rainbows}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rainbows work through reflection and refraction of visible light on water drops. (insert image here)
    \item When the light refracts into the water drops, it reflects back and emerges out of the water drops, dispersing the light in the process.
    \item What about double rainbows? These are due to the secondary reflection from the light going into the water drops.
    \item If you're high up enough, sometimes you can see a circle rainbow \begin{center}

\end{itemize}

\section*{Total Internal Reflection}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Snell's Law (again): \[n_{1}\sin{\theta_{1}} = n_{2}\sin{\theta_{2}}\]
    \item Critical angle of total internal reflection ray: \[\theta_{c} = \sin^{-1}{\Big(\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}\Big)}\]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Fiber Optics}

\section*{Practice Problem 1}
A small light is placed at the bottom of a 3.25 m deep swimming pool. What is the diameter of the circle of light seen on the water's surface from above?

\section*{Practice Problem 2}
A ray of light travels through air parallel to the base of the prism to the right
