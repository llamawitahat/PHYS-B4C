\title{Physics III: Chapter 34 - Notes from the Reading}
\author{Jake Kratt}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

This chapter continues from the electromagnetic waves discussed in Chapter 33. For the next few chapters on optics, we'll be focusing on light as an electromagnetic wave. This chapter will begin by discussing the nature of light and early methods for measuring the speed of light. Next, we'll be looking at the phenomena of geometric optics: reflection from a surface and refraction as light crosses the boundary between two media. After all of that, we'll take a look at what's called total internal refraction, which is the basis of operation for things like fiber optic cables. All of this will give us a decent background of knowledge going into Chapter 35, which will take a look at how light interacts with mirrors and lenses.
